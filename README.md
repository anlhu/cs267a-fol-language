### Docker Dev Container
We provide a Docker Dev Container with all the requirements installed. To use this, ensure you have VS Code and the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension installed. 

From VS Code, open the Command Palette with Shift + Command + P (Mac) / Ctrl + Shift + P (Windows/Linux). Enter `Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume` and paste the link to the repository. Then select the `main` branch. This will create a container running Ubuntu 24.04 with all the requirements and some useful extensions preinstalled.
